###Brief 1

#### Point of View(POV) Due (10/22): 

Create a video recording from the first perspective (1 minute max). The point of view(POV) can be taken from the perspective of animate and inanimate objects. Consider the power of perspective. Whose eyes are we looking through? Feel free to include audio or to filter the video in any way you like. The rest of the class will be much more open ended. The projects will be self guided with he theme of augmented reality as a driver. This assignment is an exercise to attempt to transmit perspective.

###Brief 2

Design an augmented reality tour which challenges or complicates the usual tropes of AR experiences. You do not need to engineer the entire tour, but you must find a way to prototype the AR experiece of one essential aspect. If you design a site specific tour, then you must be prepared to present it within the confines of the 4 block radius of the wind tunnel (we can all use our imaginations...).
immersive experience.

####Talking points, possible starting places:
   
   *what is real? if everything is mediated, how do you recognize anything else?
   different types of immersion and augmentation
   * emotionally, narratively, or aesthetically beyond what’s around
   * telepresence, traveling without moving
   * changes in scale, perspective
   * changes in the rules of reality, e.g. ‘designing coincidence’persona or niche culture
   * challenging disruptive fantasy landscape
   * fusion of information space and urban space
   *  a tour has a tour guide, but not necessarily a human person
