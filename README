COURSE DESCRIPTION

Bruce Sterling described Augmented Reality (AR) as “the collision of metaphysics and technology,” but AR—defined as realtime video composite technology that overlays information, graphics and animation through displays—often remains the gimmick sibling to the even more trivialized virtual reality.
Google glass and Oculus Rift style hardware combined with motion capture, face recognition, sensors, GPS, and other detection software could mean several possible futures for AR. This studio will focus on the assumption that AR will transition into a primary language of general computing.
The studio will include workshops, readings, viewings, demos that will inspire student exploration leading the creation of an original AR application. The final output should expand the scope of AR to guide a user through a poetic, critical and psychological immersive experience.
Technical requirements
This course will meet twice a week the last 4 weeks of the semester. While programming will not be taught we will use various software and hardware platforms including camera's, computers, open-source software, etc. Students will be required to discuss technical methods as a sportive component of the conceptual. It is necessary that these projects be completed by the final crit day. technical perimeters for successful completion of the project must be sorted within the first part of the class so the remainder of the time can be spent honing the experience of the project.  

Syllabus
Week 1 (10/21): Point of View

Assignment for first class. Prepare a video. Create a video recording from the first perspective. The point of view can be taken from the perspective of animate and inanimate objects. Consider the power of perspective. Whose eyes are we looking through? Feel free to include audio or to filter the video in any way you like. The rest of the class will be much more open ended. The projects will be self guided with he theme of augmented reality as a driver. This assignment is an exercise to consider an important feature of transmitting perspective. Imagine capturing experience as apposed to capturing moments.

Find on the Github the class syllabus. Ben Hooker and David Leonard will be adding information, files, code, readings, links and other material on the site. For those who would like to keep their relationships with git a surface experience. I suggest creating a file in which to download a zip file from the repository. Unzip the file and explore. Since the repository will be constantly updated it is a good idea to keep an eye out for goodies that may show up. For those more adventurous in the world of git. There are plenty of tutorials out their to set up git on your computer. You can create your own branches and forks from your own projects or to others.
