###Course description

Bruce Sterling described Augmented Reality (AR) as “the collision of metaphysics and technology,” but AR—defined as realtime video composite technology that overlays information, graphics and animation through displays—often remains the gimmick sibling to the even more trivialized virtual reality.
Google glass and Oculus Rift style hardware combined with motion capture, face recognition, sensors, GPS, and other detection software could mean several possible futures for AR. This studio will focus on the assumption that AR will transition into a primary language of general computing.
The studio will include workshops, readings, viewings, demos that will inspire student exploration leading the creation of an original AR application. The final output should expand the scope of AR to guide a user through a poetic, critical and psychological immersive experience.

###Technical requirements

This course will meet twice a week the last 4 weeks of the semester. While programming will not be taught we will use various software and hardware platforms including camera's, computers, open-source software, etc. Students will be required to discuss technical methods as a sportive component of the conceptual. It is necessary that these projects be completed by the final crit day. technical perimeters for successful completion of the project must be sorted within the first part of the class so the remainder of the time can be spent honing the experience of the project.
