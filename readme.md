De_Tourism
======================================

* David Leonard and Ben Hooker
* MPD Art Center  Fall 2013
* Tuesdays and Thursdays 4:00-7:00
* Office hours TBA 
* TA Aaron Fooshee 

###Important links

* [github repo](https://github.com/dltv/de_tourism) - Readme contains course information, repo also serves as a collection of scripts and tools for augmented reality.

###Course description

Bruce Sterling described Augmented Reality (AR) as “the collision of metaphysics and technology,” but AR—defined as realtime video composite technology that overlays information, graphics and animation through displays—often remains the gimmick sibling to the even more trivialized virtual reality.
Google glass and Oculus Rift style hardware combined with motion capture, face recognition, sensors, GPS, and other detection software could mean several possible futures for AR. This studio will focus on the assumption that AR will transition into a primary language of general computing.
The studio will include workshops, readings, viewings, demos that will inspire student exploration leading the creation of an original AR application. The final output should expand the scope of AR to guide a user through a poetic, critical and psychological immersive experience.

###Technical requirements

This course will meet twice a week the last 4 weeks of the semester. While programming will not be taught we will use various software and hardware platforms including camera's, computers, open-source software, etc. Students will be required to discuss technical methods as a sportive component of the conceptual. It is necessary that these projects be completed by the final crit day. technical perimeters for successful completion of the project must be sorted within the first part of the class so the remainder of the time can be spent honing the experience of the project.

###Syllabus

#### POV Due (10/22): 

Prepare a video. Create a video recording from the first perspective. The point of view can be taken from the perspective of animate and inanimate objects. Consider the power of perspective. Whose eyes are we looking through? Feel free to include audio or to filter the video in any way you like. The rest of the class will be much more open ended. The projects will be self guided with he theme of augmented reality as a driver. This assignment is an exercise to consider an important feature of transmitting perspective. Imagine capturing experience as apposed to capturing moments.

* What is the difference between capturing a moment and experience? 
* How are can you express perspective?

* __Assignment due 9/30:__
    * Create an HPI (human programming interface) that allows others to control some aspect of your life. By __next week (9/23)__ you should have the system built and in place and ready for a one week trial / performance / experiment.
    * Creatively misuse an existing API in order to reveal something about the service.
    * By __next week (9/23)__ read exerpt sent out, post a tweet inspired by it tagged #socialhacking.

####Weeks 4 (9/30): extensions and customization
* Review HPI and misused API work
* Break
* Discussion: extension and customization
	* Extensions change your experience transparently, instead of drawing our attention to the object itself. While an API is something that exposes specific ways of interacting with a system, shielding the system from direct manipulation, an extension is generally something that is integrated directly with a system.
	* Remember the Goffman reading. How do these things fit together?
* Examples
	* Making an invisible layer on top of normal social space, you have to know the code or have the extension to see it.
